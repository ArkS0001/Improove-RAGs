# Improove-RAGs

67% of RAG systems retrieve junk.

Because their embeddings are trash.

Most devs focus on retrieval but skip the foundation: 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀.

Miss this, and your system fails—hallucinations, slow search, irrelevant results.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀?

They convert text into dense numerical vectors that capture meaning.

Without embeddings, search is just keywords. With embeddings, RAG understands context.

Example: 
- Search “best laptop for coding”?
- A keyword-based system returns exact word matches.
- Embeddings find developer-friendly laptops—even if those words aren’t there.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗗𝗼 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗥𝗔𝗚?

Every query is mapped to a vector space.

- Bad embeddings → wrong documents → hallucinations.
- Weak context → irrelevant LLM responses.
- Slow search → frustrated users.

𝗛𝘆𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗱 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 (𝗗𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲 + 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀)

Most RAG systems only use dense embeddings, which capture meaning but miss exact matches.

Sparse embeddings match keywords but lack context.

Hybrid search combines both, ensuring precise, relevant results.

- Dense-only retrieval? Loosely related content.
- Sparse-only? Exact words, no meaning.
- Hybrid? The best of both worlds.

𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗥𝗔𝗚

🔹 OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small, 3-large) – General-purpose, state-of-the-art accuracy, but expensive.
🔹 Cohere (embed-multilingual-v3) – Strong multilingual support, flexible, but may need domain adaptation.
🔹 E5 & BGE (Open-Source) – Free, customizable, optimized for search-heavy apps but requires tuning.
🔹 Fine-Tuned Models – Best for domain-specific retrieval, but need compute and expertise.

𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗲-𝗧𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀: 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 & 𝗪𝗵𝘆?

Fine-tuning unlocks next-level accuracy.

- Legal/medical RAG? Captures industry terms.
- Code retrieval? Understands function/class intent.
- Customer support AI? Learns product-specific language.

When to fine-tune?
- If generic models give irrelevant results.
- If retrieval is slow and needs optimization.
- If your dataset has unique jargon.
